 Program: RoBach
 
 Description: When this program is started, it will ask the user for a musical key and the beats per minute they would like
 				      the program to play at. Once the user inputs this information, the program will start playing random notes
 				      and chords at random lengths in the scale chosen by the user. Note that a third party program the emulates
 				      instrument playing by keyboard is required for this to work.
